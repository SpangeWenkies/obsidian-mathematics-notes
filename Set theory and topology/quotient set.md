# Definition: quotient set

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- let $\sim$ be an [[Equivalence relation]] on $M$, then define the quotient set $$
^{M}/_{\sim}:=\{ [m]|m\in M \}$$
- note: this constitutes a set through [[Principle of restricted comprehension]] as we may say that $[m]\in\mathcal{P}(M)$, where the latter is the [[Power set]] and by the [[Axiom of existence of power sets]] it exists
- note: the [[Axiom of choice]] gives that $\exists$ a [[complete system of representatives of an equivalence relation]] , i.e., a set $R$ s.t. $R\simeq_{set} \ ^{M}/_{\sim}$
	- i.e., there exists a [[Bijection]] with the quotient set
- note: care must be taken to check if not ill-defined if we define [[Map]] whose [[Domain]] is a quotient set and if one uses [[representative|representatives]] to define the map (https://youtu.be/6EIWRg-6ftQ?si=WaZ9RENYeku4-M2c)
