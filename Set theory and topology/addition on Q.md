# Definition: addition on Q

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Take care in defining the addition on $\mathbb{Q}$, such to not make the mistake of adding quotients as numerator + numerator divided by denominator + denominator, as in the [[fools-addition on Q]] 
- define $+_{\mathbb{Q}}:\mathbb{Q}\times \mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{Q}$
- $[(x,y)]+_{\mathbb{Q}}[(u,v)]:=[(x\cdot_{\mathbb{Z}}v+y\cdot_{\mathbb{Z}}u, y\cdot_{\mathbb{Z}}v)]$ 
- as we use $\mathbb{Q}$, which is a [[quotient set]] in the [[Domain]], we must check if it is well-defined
