# Definition: Axiom of infinity

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- There exists a set that contains $\emptyset$ and with every of its elements $y$ it also contains as an element ${y}$
- Now if we start with the simplest of such sets we take the set with only empty sets: $$\{ \emptyset, \{ \emptyset \},\{ \{ \emptyset \} \},\{ \{ \{ \emptyset \} \} \},\dots \}$$
- We can notate this set as $\{ 1,2,3,4,\dots \}$ and thus we have defined the [[Natural numbers]] and by the axiom of infinity the natural numbers are a set
	- By using the power set of the natural numbers, which is equal to the real numbers, we can also say that the real numbers are a set.
