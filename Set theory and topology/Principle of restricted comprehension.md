# Definition: Principle of restricted comprehension

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $P$ be a [[predicate]] of one variable and let $m$ be a set
- Then those elements $y \in m$ for which $P(y)$ holds, constitute a set
- The notation of this is $$\{ y \in m|P(y) \}:=im_{R}(m)$$ where $im_{R}(m)$ is the [[Image]]
- It is the better version of [[Principle of universal comprehension]] as now we have that the set can not grow bigger than the set the $y$ originally come from, which is $m$. This is the "restricted" part in the name of the principle of restricted comprehension
## Intuition (optional)
- Used to further state the [[complement]] and [[intersection]] of a set being sets
