# Definition: Axiom of foundation

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Every non-empty set $x$ contains an element $y$ that has none of its elements in common with $x$ 

## Intuition (optional)
- There is no set that contains itself as an element, i.e., $x \in x$ for no set $x$ 
- if we do not have this axiom, we must built every set from the $\emptyset$
