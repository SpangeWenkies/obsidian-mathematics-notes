# Definition: Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms including the axiom of choice (ZFC)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- For all Mathematics and set theory we need the following 9 axioms to define sets and the [[epsilon relation]] 
- Earlier mathematics used "naïve" set theory in which we have [[Russel's paradox]] and thus inconsistencies brought by the from naïve set theory deriven [[Principle of universal comprehension]] . Modern set theory is based on the ZFC axioms and leaves inconsistencies behind.
- The axioms are abbreviated as EE PURP IC F
- They are:
	- [[Axiom on epsilon-relation]] E
	- [[Axiom of existence of an empty set]] E
	- [[Axiom on pair sets]] P
	- [[Axiom on union sets]] U
	- [[Axiom of replacement]] R
	- [[Axiom of existence of power sets]] P
	- [[Axiom of infinity]] I
	- [[Axiom of choice]] C
	- [[Axiom of foundation]] F
