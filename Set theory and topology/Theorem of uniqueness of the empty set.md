# Theorem: Theorem of uniqueness of the empty set

**Type:** #theorem  

## Statement
- There is only one empty set $\emptyset$

## Proof Idea (optional)
- Using the [[Axiom of existence of an empty set]]
- Assume $x$ and $x'$ both empty set
	- then $(y\in x)\implies(y\in x'), \  \forall y$ is something we can write as $(y \in x)$ is just a false [[proposition]] 
	- this implies $x\subseteq x'$
	- we can do the same but for $(y\in x')$
	- this implies $x'\subseteq x$
	- now by [[equality]] definition we get that $x=x'$ and thus the empty set is unique
