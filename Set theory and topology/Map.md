**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A map $\phi:A \to B$ is a [[relation]] s.t. for every $a\in A$ there exists exactly one $b\in B$ s.t. $\phi(a,b)$ (is true) 
- Notation $\phi: A \to B, a \mapsto \phi(a)$, but this hides the fact that it is a relation and relations "eat" two values and are true or false, i.e., $\phi(a,b)$, because $\phi(a):=b$, which is the unique value that makes a map a map
