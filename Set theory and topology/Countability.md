# Definition: Countability

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A set is countable if it is finite or can be made 1-to-1 with $\mathbb{N}$
- Countable infinite sets exist
	- It is countably infinite if its [[Cardinality]] is equal to the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$ denoted as $\aleph_{0}$ ([[Aleph-null]])

## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- A set is countable if there exists an [[Injection|injective]] function from the set to $\mathbb{N}$
- A set $X$ is also countable if $\exists$ a [[Surjection|surjective]] function $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\mapsto X$ 
- A set $X$ is also countable if we take $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $\exists f: X\mapsto A$ which is [[Bijection|bijective]]
	- if $A=\mathbb{N}$, it is countably infinite
- If $\text{Cardinality}(X)<\aleph_{0}$ then it is countable
- A set $X$ is countably infinite if it is [[Isomorphism]] (set-theory) to the [[Natural numbers]]
