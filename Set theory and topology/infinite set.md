# Definition: infinite set

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A set $A$ is infinite if there exists a proper subset $B\subset A$ that is [[Isomorphism]] to $A$ 
	- We can see that this can not hold for finite sets intuitively
	- If this does not hold a set is finite
- Two types of infinite:
	- [[Countability|countably infinite]]: $A$ isomorphic (set-theory) to [[Natural numbers]]
	- non-countably infinite
