# Definition: Axiom of replacement

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $R$ be a [[functional relation]] 
- The axiom of replacement gives that the set of elements that make the [[Image]] of the functional relation, is itself a set.
- From this axiom of replacement comes the weaker version which is the [[Principle of restricted comprehension]], not to be confused with the inconsistent/incorrect [[Principle of universal comprehension]] stemming form naïve set theory
