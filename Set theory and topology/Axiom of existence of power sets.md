# Definition: Axiom of existence of power sets

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $m$ be a set, then there exists a set denoted $\mathcal{P}(m)$ whose elements are precisely the subsets of $m$


## Intuition (optional)
- e.g.: take $m=\{ a,b \}$ and we do not know where $a,b$ come from, we can not use [[Principle of restricted comprehension]], so we need a new axiom for this to make it possible.
	- $\implies \mathcal{P}(m)=\{ \emptyset,\{ a \},\{ b \},\{ a,b \} \}$
		- note that the empty set is always a subset of any set
		- This power set is larger than $m$
