# Definition: Isomorphism

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- if there exists between to sets $A,B$ a [[Bijection]] preserving the original structure, then these are called isomorphic (in set theory)
- notation: $A\simeq_{set} B$ 
- if $\exists$ any bijection then generally there are many of such functions and it is then a property of $A,B$

## Intuition (optional)
- This is a better notion than sets having equal size
	- in [[infinite set]] size is not defined, but we can see if a bijection exists

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- Must be measurable and [[Inverse measurability|inverse measurable]]
