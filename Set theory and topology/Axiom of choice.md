# Definition: Axiom of choice

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $x$ be a set whose elements are non-empty and [[mutually disjoint]] 
- Then there exists a set $y$ which contains exactly only one element of each element of $x$
- we call the set $y$ a "dark" set as we do not need to define a way of picking the elements from $x$ to say that $y$ is a set
	- if we would algorithmicly pick elements from elements of $x$, we would not need to have an axiom of choice (this makes the axiom independent of the other 8 axioms)
	- however if we could not differentiate between the elements in the elements of $x$ and thus not algorithmicly pick them to put them in some $y$, then we need to say that still $y$ will constitute a set
- a number of theorems still require the axiom of choice for proofs
	- [[zorn's lemma]] stemming from the axiom of choice is used to proof every [[vector space]] has a basis
	- proving there always exists a [[complete system of representatives of an equivalence relation]]
	- 
## Intuition (optional)
- picking elements from elements of x and putting this in a set makes sure that the set you put it in is indeed a set
