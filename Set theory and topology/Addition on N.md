# Definition: Addition on N

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- $+:\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}, (m,n)\mapsto m+n:=S^n(m)$
- We can show that $0$ is the [[natural element]] of addition
	- $m+0=S^{0}(m)=m$
	- $0+m=\dots=m$
- We see that in $\mathbb{N}$ addition has no [[inverse element]] 
	- to have an inverse element means addition in $\mathbb{N}$ is not of a [[commutative group]], therefore it lacks one of the [[group axioms]] 
	- we however can define this element on the set of [[integer numbers]] $\mathbb{Z}$ , based of the natural numbers
