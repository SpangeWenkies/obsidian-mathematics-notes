# Definition: Principle of universal comprehension

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- from naive set theory, leads to [[Russel's paradox]]
- PRC: $\{ y \in m|P(y) \}:=im_{R}(m)$
- "P"UC: $\{ y |P(y) \}:=im_{R}(m)$
- [[Principle of restricted comprehension]], but we do not give what set $y$ comes from
- Would have been easily usable in [[generation]] of sets using repeated [[Power set]]
	- But since we want to generate the set and thus do not know what it is to define where $y$ would come from, we can not do this
