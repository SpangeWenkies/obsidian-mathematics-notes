# Definition: equivalence class

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- If $\sim$ is an [[Equivalence relation]] on $M$
- then for any $m\in M$ we define $$[m]:=\{ n\in M|m\sim n \}\subseteq M,$$ as the set that is the equivalence class of $M$

## Intuition/properties (optional)
- $a\in[m]\implies[a]=[m]$, i.e., any element of the equivalence class can act as a [[representative]] of the equivalence class
- either $[m]=[n]$ or $[m]\cap[n]=\emptyset$
