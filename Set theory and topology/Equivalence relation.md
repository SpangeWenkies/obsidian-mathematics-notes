# Definition: Equivalence relation

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $M$ be a set and $\sim$ a [[relation]] s.t. the following three hold:
	- [[reflexivity]]: $\forall m\in M: \ m \sim m$, note that this means $m\sim m$ is true
	- [[symmetry]]: $\forall m,n\in M: m\sim n \iff n\sim m$
	- [[Transitivity]]: $\forall m,n,p \in M:m\sim n \land n\sim p \implies m\sim p$
	Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $M$ 

## Intuition (optional)


## Examples
- take the relation "is of same opinion as"
	- then it is reflexive, symmetric, transitive
- take the relation "is sibling of"
	- then this is symmetric and transitive, but **not** reflexive
	- so it is no equivalence relation
- take the relation "is in love with"
	- this is only on occasion reflexive, only usually symmetric, mostly not transitive
	- so it is no equivalence relation
