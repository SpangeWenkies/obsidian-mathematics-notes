# Definition: Measure singularity ($\nu \perp \mu$)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- $\exists$ a [[Measurability|measurable]] set $A$ s.t. 
	- $\mu(A)=0\text{ and }\nu(X \setminus A)=0$
	- i.e. $\mu$ and $\nu$ live on disjoint parts of the [[Measure space]] $X$ 
 
## Intuition (optional)

## Examples
- counting measure on $\mathbb{N}$ vs a Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$ 
	- set $\mathbb{N}$ has Lebesgue measure zero
	- the complement of $\mathbb{N}$ has counting measure zero
	$\implies$ $m_{count}\perp m_{Leb}$ 

- Dirac delta vs Lebesgue measure
	- Take $\delta_{0}$ as point mass at 0
		- Lebesgue measure sees $\{ 0 \}$ as a null-set
		- $\delta_{0}$ sees exactly only $\{ 0 \}$ as non-zero
	$\implies$ $\delta_{0}\perp dx$ 

- In dirichlet forms in the energy form the killing part is singular w.r.t. the measure often
