# Definition: Openness

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Provides a method of distinguishing points on a [[Topological space]] , like you would in a [[Metric space]], but now without a notion of distance.

- A set can never been considered as open by itself. This notion is relative to a containing set and a specific topology on it.

- Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space
	A set $U \subseteq X$ is open if
	- $U \in \tau$, where $\tau$ is the [[topology]]

- All members of a topology are open sets.

## Intuition (optional)
- For each $x \in U$  there is "wiggle room", i.e., a small enough [[neighbourhood]] around it always exists and is fully contained within the set
	- In metric spaces we call the neighbourhood an open ball
- Infinite intersections of open sets need not be open. 
	e.g., the intersection of all intervals of the form $(−1/n,1/n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer, is the set $\{ 0 \}$, which is not open in $\mathbb{R}$.
