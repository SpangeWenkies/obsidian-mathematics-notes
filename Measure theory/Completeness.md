**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A complete measure (space) is a [[Measure space|measure space]] $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ in which every subset of every [[Null set]] is [[Measurability|measurable]] and has [[Measure zero|measure zero]]

## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- A measure space is complete iff $S \subseteq N \in \Sigma$ and then if $\mu(N)=0\implies S \in \Sigma$

## Completion of a measure space
- For a (possibly incomplete) measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$, there is an extension $(X, \Sigma_{0}, \mu_{0})$, which is complete. The smallest [[Sigma algebra]] $\Sigma_{0}$ is called the [[Completion]] of the measure space.

How to construct:
- let $Z$ be the set of all subsets of the measure zero subsets of $X$. We then have that the elements in $Z$, which are not in $\Sigma$ prevent completeness
- let $\Sigma_{0}$ be the sigma algebra generated by both $\Sigma$ and $Z$, i.e., the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing every element of $\Sigma$ and of $Z$ 
- $\mu$ has extension $\mu_{0}$ to $\Sigma_{0}$ , which is unique if $\mu$ is [[Sigma finite]] 
	This $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Outer measure]] of $\mu$, given by the following [[Infimum]] $$\mu_{0}(C):= \inf \{ \mu(D) : C \subseteq D \subseteq \Sigma \}$$

- Every member in $\Sigma_{0}$ is of form $A \cup B$ for some $A \in \Sigma$ and some $B \in Z$ and that $\mu_{0}(A \cup B)=\mu(A)$ 

## Examples
- If we have a [[Borel measure]] generated by the [[Openness|open]] interval of the $\mathbb{R}$-line, it is not complete. If we get its completion it results in the complete [[Lebesgue measure]]
- A n-dimensional Lebesgue measure is the completion of the n-fold product of a one-dimensional Lebesgue space with itself. In the $n=1$ case we get the above example.
