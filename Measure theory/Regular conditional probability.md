# Definition: Regular conditional probability property

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Given a probability $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ and sub [[Sigma algebra]] $\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$
- A map $\omega \mapsto P(A|\mathcal{G})(\omega)$ has regular conditional probabilities if
	- it behaves like a conditional probability of $A|\mathcal{G}$
	- it is regular, i.e., a true probability measure for each fixed $\omega$ and [[Measurability|measurable]] in $\omega$

- These axioms are only guaranteed to be with the right properties on [[Standard Borel space|standard Borel spaces]]
