# Definition: Borel algebra

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Given a [[Topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ the Borel $\sigma$-algebra is the smallest $\sigma$-[[Sigma algebra|algebra]] containing all [[Openness|open]] sets of a set $X$, denoted as $B(X):=\sigma(\tau)$ 

- [[Borel set|Borel sets]] are subsets of a topological space that has a Borel algebra are a class of subsets of the space

- An arbitrary subset of some topological space can fail to be [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]], but every Borel set of that same space is always a [[Universally measurable set]]
