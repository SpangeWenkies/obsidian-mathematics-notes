# Definition: Bounded variation

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A real-valued function whose [[Total variation]] is [[Totally bounded|bounded]] (finite)
- These functions work in [[Riemann-Stieltjes integral|Riemann-Stieltjes integrals]] 

## Intuition (optional)

## Properties / consequences
- These functions $f$ can be written as the difference between two bounded [[Monotonicity|monotone]] functions $f=g-h$
- Functions $f$ may have [[Discontinuities]] but only [[Countability|countably]] many
- All such functions $f$ together form a [[Sigma algebra]] of discountinuous functions whose first derivative exists [[almost everywhere]]
