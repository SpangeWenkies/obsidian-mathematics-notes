# Definition: Standard Borel space

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Start with a [[Polish space]] $(X,\tau)$ , which is a [[Topological space]] that is [[Separability|separable]] and [[Complete metric space|completely metrizable]] 
- Take the Polish space its [[Borel algebra]] $\mathcal{B}(X)=\sigma(\tau)$ which contains all sets from
	- starting with the [[Openness|open]] sets and then [[Closure|closing under]] countable unions, intersections and complements
- The space defined as $(X,\mathcal{B}(X))$ is then called a Standard Borel space

## Intuition (optional)
- It is a Polish space that is [[Borel isomorphic]] to the Borel algebra of a Polish space
	- i.e., $(X,\Sigma)$ is Standard Borel $\iff$ $\exists$ a Polish space $(Y,\tau)$ with $(X,\Sigma)$ [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $(Y,\mathcal{B}(Y))$
