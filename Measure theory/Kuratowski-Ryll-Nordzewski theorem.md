# Theorem: Kuratowski-Ryll-Nordzewski theorem

**Type:** #theorem  

## Statement
- Gives a statement on when a [[Measure||measurable selection]] exists

- If a space $X$ is a [[Standard Borel space]] and $\forall x \in X$ we have that a [[Set-valued map]] $\Phi:X \mapsto \mathcal{P}(Y)$ its evaluations $\Phi(x)$ form a non-empty, [[Closure|closed]] subset of a [[Polish space]] and the [[Graph]] of the set-valued map $\Phi$ is [[Measurability|measurable]] 
	$\implies$ a measurable selection exists
