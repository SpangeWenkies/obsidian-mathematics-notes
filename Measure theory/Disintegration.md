# Definition: Disintegration (of measures)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- We disintegrate a joint [[Measure]] if we write it as the $\text{conditional} \times \text{ marginal}$ like so$$P(X,Y)=P(X|Y)P(Y)$$

## Intuition (optional)
- Like the conditional probability

## Examples
- a probability measure $\mu$ on [[Product space]] $X\times Y$ split as the marginal on $Y$ and a family of conditional measures on $X$ for each element $y \in Y$ is written as $$\mu(A\times B)=\int_{B}\mu(A|y)\nu(dy),$$
	where $\nu=\mu_{Y}$, which is the marginal of the measure on $Y$ and $y \mapsto \mu(.|y)$ is a [[Measurability|measurable]] family of measures
