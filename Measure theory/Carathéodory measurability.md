# Definition: Carathéodory measurability

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Given an [[Outer measure]] $\mu^{*}$ , a set $E \subseteq X$ is said to be Carathéodory-measurable, i.e., $\mu^{*}$-measurable if: $$\mu^{*}(A)=\mu^{*}(A \cap E) + \mu^{*}(A \setminus E) \text{, }\forall A \subseteq X$$
- The collection of all such sets $A$ form a [[Sigma algebra]], and the [[Carathéodory outer measure]] $\mu^{*}$ restricted to that $\sigma$-algebra is a [[Measure]]
