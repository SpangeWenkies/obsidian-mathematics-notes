# Definition: Outer measure

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Given a set $X$ and the collection of subsets of $X$ including $\emptyset$ denoted by $2^X$, an outer measure is a [[Set function]] $$\mu^{*}:2^{X} \mapsto [0,\infty],$$ s.t.
	- the measure zero equals zero, i.e., $\mu^{*}(\emptyset)=0$
	- [[Monotonicity]] holds for $\mu^{*}$, i.e., if $A \subseteq B$ then $\mu^{*}(A)\leq \mu^{*}(B)$
	- $\mu$ is [[Countable additivity|countably subadditive]], i.e., for arbitrary subsets $A,B_{1},B_{2},\dots \subseteq X$, if $A \subseteq \bigcup^{\infty}_{j=1}B_{j}$ then $\mu^{*}(A)\leq \sum^{\infty}_{j=1}\mu(B_{j})$

- Most commonly a [[Carathéodory outer measure]] arises from the following construction:
	- Given a set function $\rho$ defined on a collection of [[Simple set|simple sets]] (e.g. intervals), we define $$\mu^{*}(A)=\inf\left\{  \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\rho(E_{n}):A \subseteq \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1}E_{n}  \right\}$$ as the Carathéodory outer measure generated by $\rho$ 
	
## Intuition (optional)
- An outer measure assigns "size" to **every** subset of a set $X$. So also [[Measurability|non-measurable]] ones.
	- It is the best attempt to measure all subsets
	- It possibly **overestimates** the true size, until we restrict it to a [[Sigma algebra]] of “Carathéodory-measurable" sets, see [[Carathéodory extension theorem]]
