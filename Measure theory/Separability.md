# Definition: Separability

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A space if separable if it has a [[Schauder basis]] $S$, which is:
	- [[Countability|countable]] itself (not as a subset of some other space)
	- [[orthonormal basis]] 

- A [[Topological space]] is separable if it contains a [[Countability|countable]] [[Denseness|dense]] subset

## Intuition (optional)
- it is one of the axioms on countability and it is a "limitation on size" of a space

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- $\exists$ a sequence $\{ x_{n} \}^{\infty}_{n=1}$ of elements of the space s.t. every non-empty [[Openness|open]] subset of the space contains at least one element of the sequence
