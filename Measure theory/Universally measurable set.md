# Definition: Universally measurable set

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A subset $A$ of a [[Polish space]] $X$ is universally measurable if it is [[Measurability|measurable]] w.r.t. every [[Completeness|complete]] probability measure on $X$ measuring all [[Borel set|borel subsets]] of $X$

	$\implies$ a universally measurable set of $\mathbb{R}$ is necessarily [[Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measurable]]
