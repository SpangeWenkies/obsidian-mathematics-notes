# Definition: Topology

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- If we have a set $X$, we then pick a collection of subsets of $X$ and denote it as $\tau$.  Then $\tau$ is a topology if:
	- $\emptyset, X \in \tau$
	- any union of sets in $\tau$ is in tau, i.e., it is [[Closure|closed]] under [[Countability|countable]] unions and under finite intersections

- Together with the set a topology is generated from it is called a [[Topological space]]

## Intuition (optional)
- A topology defines [[Continuity]], [[Limit|Limits]] and [[Connectedness]], without the need for a distance to make it a [[Metric space]].
	- e.g. $f: X \mapsto Y$ is continuous if $f^{-1}(U)$ is [[Openness|open]] in X for every open $U \subseteq Y$
