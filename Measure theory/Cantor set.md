# Definition: Cantor set

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- from an [[Openness|open]] unit interval $(0,1)$ remove the middle third, leaving an [[Openness|open]] set and call it $C_{1}$
- repeat this by removing the middle thirds of the in previous steps obtained open sets until we obtain $C_{n}$ from the previous set $C_{n-1}$
- the Cantor set is then defined as $$C_{\infty}=\lim_{ n \to \infty } C_{n}=\bigcap^{\infty}_{n=0}C_{n}$$
