# Definition: λ-system (Dynkin system)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A $\lambda$-system is a collection of sets $\mathcal{D}$ satisfying:
	- $X \in\mathcal{D},$ where $X$ is some non-empty set
	- it is [[Closure|closed under]] complement
	- it is closed under [[Countability|countable]] disjoint unions
- These three axioms make it very close to a [[Sigma algebra]], but $\sigma$-algebras are closed under **all** countable unions (not just disjoint ones)
	- A $\lambda$-system is weaker than a $\sigma$-algebra


## Intuition/consequences/properties (optional)
- Proving the generation of a $\sigma$-algebra is hard, the $\lambda$-systems make it easier as
	- Complements are allowed
	- Disjoint unions are nicer to work with
	- it generally has a simpler structure

- We prove that certain classes of sets will generate $\sigma$-algebras, by showing they generate $\lambda$-systems, which are easier to prove generation of ([[Dynkin's theorem]])
