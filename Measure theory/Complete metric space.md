# Definition: Complete metric space (Cauchy space)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A [[Metric space]] $M$ is [[Completeness|complete]] if every [[Cauchy sequence]] of points in $M$ has a limit that is also in $M$
- A metric space can always be made into a complete metric space $M'$ which contains $M$ itself as a [[Denseness|dense]] subset

## Intuition (optional)
- A metric space is complete if it is not missing points inside or at the boundary

## Examples
- Wat is not a complete metric space is the set of rationals $\mathbb{Q}$, as for example $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is not in it, but it is the limit of a Cauchy sequence that can be constructed from numbers within $\mathbb{Q}$ 


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- Every compact metric space is complete, but not vice versa, s.s., a metric space is compact iff it is complete and [[Totally bounded]]
