# Definition: Reflexive space

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- If the [[Natural embedding]] of the space $X$ is a map that is [[Surjection|surjective]] , i.e., there is at least one or more $x \in X$ s.t. $J(x)=X^{**}$  then it is a reflexive space


## Intuition (optional)
- if every element of the double dual is an evaluation of the natural embedding at some element in the space, it is a reflexive space

- This means an original space $X$ can be reconstructed from its double dual
- This also means that every [[Totally bounded|bounded]] sequence has a [[Weak convergence|weakly convergent]] subsequence. This is an important property of reflexive spaces used in 
	- [[Partial differential equation]] theory
	- [[Calculus of variations]]
	- [[Optimization]] theory
	- [[Semilinear equation|Semilinear equations]] theory
	- [[Dirichlet form]] theory
	- [[Martingale convergence]] from existence of the conditional expectation, which requires [[Weak compactness]] which is gotten from the weakly convergent subsequences

- Non-reflexive spaces become too "wild" at $\infty$ to be of use in some theorems/results
## Examples
- Reflexive are [[Lp-space]] for $1<p<\infty$, [[Sobolev space]] $W^{k,p}$ for $1<p<\infty$, [[Hilbert space]], $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ 

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- $X$ and $X^{**}$ are on the same space and not just naturally embedded copies
