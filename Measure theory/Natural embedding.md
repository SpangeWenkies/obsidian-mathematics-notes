# Definition: Natural embedding

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- The natural embedding of a set is the map $J:X\mapsto X^{**}$, where $X^{**}$ is the [[Double dual]]
	- each element $x \in X$ defines a natural element $J(x)\in X^{**}$ s.t. $J(x)(f)=f(x)$ for any $f\in X^{*}$

## Intuition (optional)
- We pick $x$, feed it to any continuous linear functional f on $X$, from this we get a real number and then this mapping is itself a functional on the [[Dual space]]

- There is always a [[Canonical representation]] $J: X\mapsto X^{**}$ 

- The natural embedding is always a map that is linear, [[Injection|injective]], [[Isometric]]
