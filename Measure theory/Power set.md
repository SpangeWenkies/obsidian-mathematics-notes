# Definition: Power set

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- for a set $m$ and elements of that set $y$ (which can be sets), the power set is defined as $$\mathcal{P}(m):=\{ y|y\subseteq m \}
$$
- As we want to be able to generate sets by repeated power sets, but can not do so through only the [[Principle of universal comprehension]], as this is inconsistent. We need to establish that power sets actually exist by an axiom, s.s., [[Axiom of existence of power sets]]
