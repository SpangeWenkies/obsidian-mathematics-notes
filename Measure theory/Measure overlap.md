# Definition: Measure overlap

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- For defining how a [[Measure]] can overlap or not we use the definitions of [[Absolute continuity]] and of [[Measure singularity]] 
- A notion of overlap is needed in theory of
	- [[Radon-Nikodym theorem]]
	- [[Lebesgue decomposition]] 
	- [[Probability density]]
	- [[Change of measure]] by [[Girsanov's theorem]]
	- [[Beurling-Deny decomposition]] of [[Dirichlet form]] into its local, [[Jump]] and [[Killing]] parts
