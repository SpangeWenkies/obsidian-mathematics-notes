# Definition: Measurable function

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A function $f$ is a [[Measurability|measurable]] if the following holds:
	for $f: X \mapsto Y$, if $Y$ is a [[Measurability|measurable set]] then $X$ is aswell

## Intuition (optional)

## Example
- [[Simple function]] are measurable if the indicator set $A_{i}$ in the function is a measurable set
	This comes from the property that measurable functions are [[Closure||closed under]] finite sums, products, etc.

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- if the mapping makes sure that if the [[Target space]] is a measurable set, that then the [[Pre-image]] is a measurable set as well, then the function associated to the mapping is a measurable function
- $f$ is measurable $\iff$ $f^{-1}(A)\in \Sigma_{X}, \forall A\in \Sigma_{Y}$ , where the $\Sigma_{X}, \Sigma_{Y}$ are the [[Sigma algebra]] associated to the pre-image $X$ and the target space $Y$
