# Definition: Self-adjointness

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- An [[Operator]] / [[linear map]] $A$ with property [[Dense in space]]/[[Denseness]] defined on its [[Domain]] $\mathcal{D}_{A}$ and having some [[Target space]] $\mathcal{H}$, written as $A:\mathcal{D}_{A}\to\mathcal{H}$ 
	is self-adjoint if it [[coinciding linear maps|coincides]] with its [[adjoint]] map $A^*$ 

- To check for self-adjointness of a linear map:
	- we need to construct the adjoint map and then check if the $\mathcal{D}_{A}=\mathcal{D}_{A^{*}}$ 
	- then we check if the linear map is symmetric
	- if it is symmetric we then check if $A^{*}(\psi)=\eta$ hold
## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
 - in linear algebra a matrix is [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] if $T=T'$
	- This has nice properties s.t. the eigenvalues are in $\mathbb{R}$, they work forward and backward as [[Operator|operators]] the same way, the eigenvalues are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]], and their linear transformations do not rotate
	- The symmetry of a matrix $T$ can be shown through the [[Dot product]] by showing $\forall u,v <Tu,v> = <u,Tv>$
