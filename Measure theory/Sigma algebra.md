# Definition: $\sigma$-algebra

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A $\sigma$-algebra on a set $X$ is a non-empty collection $\Sigma$ of subsets of $X$:
	-  [[Closure|closed under]] complement, i.e, $A \subset \Sigma \implies A^{C} \subset \Sigma$ 
	-  [[Closure|closed under]] [[Countability|countable]] unions, i.e., $A_{1},\dots,A_{\infty} \subset \Sigma \implies \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1}A_{n}\subset \Sigma$
	-  [[Closure|closed under]] [[Countability|countable]] intersections, i.e., $A_{1},\dots,A_{\infty} \subset \Sigma \implies \bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1}A_{n}\subset \Sigma$

- The product $\sigma$-algebra is the $\sigma$-algebra of the [[Product space]] $$\Sigma_{1} \times \Sigma_{2} = \sigma(\{ B_{1}\times B_{2}: B_{1} \in \Sigma_{1}, B_{2} \in \Sigma_{2} \}),$$ for two measurable spaces $(X_{1},\Sigma_{1})$ and $(X_{2}, \Sigma_{2})$
## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)

## Some examples
- [[Minimal sigma algebra|Minimal/trivial sigma algebra]] is the family of $\sigma$-algebras of only $\emptyset$ and $X$
- [[Power set]] of $X$ is the discrete $\sigma$-algebra of all subsets of $X$ including $\emptyset$ and $X$
- [[Simple sigma algebra]] is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a set $A$ and has definition $\{ \emptyset, A, X \setminus A, X\}$ 
- [[Borel algebra]] is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the [[Openness|open sets]] (or closed sets) of any [[Topological space]] (in general this is not the power set)
