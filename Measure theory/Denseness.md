# Definition: Denseness

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A subset $A$ of a [[Topological space]] $X$ is dense in $X$ if $\forall x \in X$ we have $x \in A$ or $x$ is arbitrarily close to a member of $A$ 
- We call the density of a topological space $X$ the least [[Cardinality]] of a dense subset of X s.t. it is still dense in $X$
- Densedness is [[Transitivity|transitive]] 

## Intuition (optional)
- There is always an element to be found in the subset that is arbitrarily close to the element that is not in the set, but is in the greater set.
- e.g. $\mathbb{Q}$ is a dense subset in $\mathbb{R}$ , like how there is always a number arbitrarily close to a missing number like $\sqrt{ 2 }$ 

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- $A$ is dense in $X$ if the smallest [[Closure|closed]] subset of $X$ containing $A$ is $X$
	This is written as $cl_{X}(A)=X$
