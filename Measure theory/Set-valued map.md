# Definition: Set-valued map (multifunction)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- The set-valued map $\Phi: X \mapsto \mathcal{P}(Y)$ assigns a set of possible elements of $Y$ to each $x \in X$, so instead of $x \mapsto y$ we have $x \mapsto \Phi(x) = \mathcal{P}(Y) \subseteq Y$

## Intuition (optional)


## Examples
- Take the set of neighbours as $\Phi(x)$, which is dependent on the point you stand at looking at the neighbours
- Constraint problems also, e.g., $\Phi(x) = \{ y\in \mathbb{R} : y^{2}=x \}$
