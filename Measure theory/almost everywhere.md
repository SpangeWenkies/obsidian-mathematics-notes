# Definition: almost everywhere (a.e.)

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- in probability theory this is analogous to [[Almost surely|a.s.]] 
- a property hold a.e. if the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities, i.e., a property holds a.e. if it holds for all elements in a set except for in a subset of [[Measure zero]] ($\mu(N)=0$)

## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- a property holds a.e. if the set for which the property holds is [[Co-null]] 
- a property holds a.e. if it fails only on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero
