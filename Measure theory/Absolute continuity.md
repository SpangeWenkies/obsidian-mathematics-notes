# Definition: Absolute continuity

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- In functions it is...
- In measure theory we define absolute continuity $\nu\ll \mu$ the following way
	- Take $\mu,\nu$ as two [[Measure|measures]] on the same measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$
	- If $\mu(A)=0 \implies \nu(A)=0$  then $\nu$ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $\mu$ 

## Intuition (optional)
- Measure theory:
	- every "invisible set"([[Measure zero]]) to $\mu$ is also invisible to $\nu$  
	- we can see that when $\nu\ll \mu$ that $\nu$ does not put mass outside of $\mu$'s [[Support]]
