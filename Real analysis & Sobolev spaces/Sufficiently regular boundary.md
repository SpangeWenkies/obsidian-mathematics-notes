# Definition: Sufficiently regular boundary

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be an [[Openness|open]] set
- It has a sufficiently regular boundary $\partial \Omega$ if each point in it has a [[neighbourhood]] in which the [[Boundary]] can be represented as the [[Graph]] of a [[Continuous differentiability|continuously differentiable]] function

- (more formal definition including open neighbourhood, rotation of coordinates and behaviour of a $C^1$ function can be made)
## Intuition (optional)
A sufficiently regular boundary is one that:
- has no corners, cusps, spikes, or fractal behaviour,
- locally looks like a smooth surface,
- has a well-defined normal vector at every boundary point.

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- In [[C space]] notation we call it a $C^1$ boundary
