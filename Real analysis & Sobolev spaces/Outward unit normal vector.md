# Definition: Outward unit normal vector

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ have a [[Sufficiently regular boundary]] (e.g. $C^1$)
- For each $x \in \partial \Omega$ ([[Boundary]]) , the outward unit normal vector $\nu(x)$ is the vector:
	- [[Orthogonality|Orthogonal]] to $\partial \Omega$ at $x$
	- [[Pointing outward]] from $\Omega$
	- And of unit length $|v(x)|=1$

- If $\Omega$ is described locally by a [[Level set|sublevel set]] at level zero $$\Omega=\{ x:\phi (x)<0 \}$$ with $\phi$ a [[Smooth function]] and $|\nabla \phi(x)|\neq 0$, then $$\nu(x)=\frac{\nabla \phi(x)}{|\nabla \phi(x)|}$$
