# Definition: coercivity

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $V$ be a [[Normed vector space]] and $a(.,.)$ be a [[Bilinear form]] on $V$ 
- The form is called coercive (or elliptic or strongly positive) if $\exists \alpha>0$ s.t. $$a(u,u)\geq ||u||^{2}_{V}, \ \forall u\in V$$
- For functions or operations with the property of [[Convexity]] this means $$||u||_{V} \to \infty \implies a(u,u) \to \infty$$
- The bilinear form dominates the [[norm]]
- No sequence can escape to infinity
