# Definition: Function oscillation

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $u: \Omega\mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Measurable function]] on a set $\Omega$
- The oscillation of a function on a set is defined as $$\sup_{x \in \Omega} u(x)-\inf_{x \in \Omega}u(x)$$
- If $u$ is defined up to [[Almost surely]] equivalence, we define the oscillation using the [[Essential infimum]] and supremum $$\text{ess}\sup_{x \in \Omega} u(x)-\text{ess}\inf_{x \in \Omega}u(x)$$

## Intuition (optional)
- Measures how far a function fluctuates from its lowest to its highest value
- Depends on the [[Gradient]] as a small gradient should mean a small oscillation. This relationship is shown in the [[Poincaré inequality]]
