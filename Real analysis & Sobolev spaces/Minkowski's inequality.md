# Theorem: Minkowski's inequality

**Type:** #theorem  

## Statement
- It is the triangle-inequality in [[Lp-space]]
- For $1\leq p\leq \infty$  $$||f+g||_{p}\leq||f||_{p}+||g||_{p}$$
- In $L^p$
	- for $p=1$ this is a diamond-shaped unit [[Ball]]
	- for $p=2$ this is a circular-shaped [[Hilbert space]]
	- for $p=\infty$ this is square-shaped

## Proof Idea (optional)
- [[Hölder's inequality]] applied to $|f+g|^p$
- 

## Consequences / properties
- This proves that $||.||_{p}$ is a [[Norm]]
	- This thus proves that $(L^{p}, ||.||_{p})$ is a [[Banach space]]
- It says a space is "convex" enough to have a norm
