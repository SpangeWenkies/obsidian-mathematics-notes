# Definition: Variational sense

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Some property holds in the variational sense if it is expressed through the integral against a [[Test function]] rather than pointwise


## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- A property holds “variationally” if it is formulated via: 
	- [[Integration by parts]]
	- [[Weak derivative]]
	- [[Weak limit]] 
	- [[Test function]]
