# Definition: Test function

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Test functions are [[Test object|test objects]] 
- They are an [[Openness|open]] set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and are functions $\phi \in C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega)$, which are [[Smooth function]] having a [[Compact support]] 
- They are thus infinitely [[Differentiability|differentiable]]

## Intuition (optional)
- They are [[Dense in space]] in Sobolev and $L^p$ spaces
