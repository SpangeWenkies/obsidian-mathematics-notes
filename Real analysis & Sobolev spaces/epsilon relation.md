# Definition: epsilon relation

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- The $\in$-relation.
- Set theory is built on the [[postulate]] that there exists a fundamental [[relation]] called $\in$
- Instead of defining the relation we give meaning to the interplay of it through the [[Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms including the axiom of choice]] 
- From it we can immediately define further relations like 
	- $\not\in(x,y):= x\not\in y:\iff¬(x \in y)$ [[not in]]
	- $x \subseteq y:\iff \forall a:(a\in x \implies a\in y)$ [[subset]]
	- $x=y :\iff x\subseteq y \text{ and }y\subseteq x$ [[equality]]
