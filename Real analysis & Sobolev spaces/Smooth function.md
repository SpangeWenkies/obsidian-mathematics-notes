# Definition: Smooth function

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A function $u: \Omega\mapsto \mathbb{R}$, with $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a smooth function (or $C^\infty$ in [[C space]]) if all partial derivatives of all [[Partial order]] exist and are [[Continuity|continuous]]  

## Intuition (optional)
- Smooth functions are infinitely [[Differentiability|differentiable]] without singularities
- Usually the best-behaved functions there are and thus used as [[Test function|test functions]] in all kinds of theory

## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
- $u\in C^\infty(\Omega)\iff D^{\alpha}u\in C(\Omega)$ for every [[Multi-index]] $\alpha$ , where $D^{\alpha}u$ is the [[Weak derivative]] of order $|\alpha|$
