# Definition: Integration by parts

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be [[Openness|open]]
- Let $u,v \in C^1(\bar{\Omega})$ or [[Sufficiently smooth function]] 
- The integration by parts formula is as follows $$\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{i}}v\text{ }dx=\int_{\partial \Omega}u \ v \ \nu_{i} \ dS \ - \ \int u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x_{i}}dx,$$ where $\int_{\partial \Omega}\dots dS$ is a [[Boundary integral]] and $\nu_{i}$ is the i-th component of the [[Outward unit normal vector]] on the [[Boundary]] $\partial \Omega$
