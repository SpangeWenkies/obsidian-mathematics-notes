# Definition: Compact support

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be [[Openness|open]] and $u:\Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, the [[Support]] of $u$ is: $$\text{supp}(u)=\overline{\{ x \in \Omega :u(x)\neq 0\}}$$
- The support is then a [[Compactness|compact]] support when it is a compact subset of $\Omega$

## Intuition (optional)
- A compactly supported function $u$ is zero outside some bounded region. This region is closed and bounded "with no pathological tails"
- This ensures:
	- Integrals are finite
	- The [[Integration by parts]] boundary term vanishes
	- a definition of [[Test function]]
	- [[Partial differential equation]] and [[Sobolev space]] proofs
