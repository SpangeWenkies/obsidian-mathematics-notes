# Definition: trace-class

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- a [[linear map]] $A$ is of trace-class if for any [[orthonormal basis]] $\{ e_{n} \}$ (finite or not) $$\sum_{n}<e_{n},Ae_{n}> \ \ <\infty$$
	- in evaluating $Ae_{n}$ we need the linear map $A$ its [[Domain]] to be equal to the [[Target space]] 
		- for the Hilbert space example this means $A:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$
		- otherwise we do not know that for **any** orthonormal basis $Ae_{n}$ happens to lie in the domain of $A$

## Intuition (optional)


## Equivalent Formulations (optional)
 - If some [[linear map]] , written as a matrix, has that that matrix has a [[trace]] 
 - This is obvious for finite cases, but not always the case for infinite setting
