# Definition: Banach space

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A [[Completeness|complete]] [[Euclidean space]], but generalized to infinite dimensions
- Start with defining a [[Normed vector space]]
- Now use the notion of a [[Completion]] to construct a complete normed vector space
- This complete normed vector space is what we then call a Banach space

## Intuition (optional)

## Properties / consequences
- Now on this space because of the completion and norm the following are applicable:
	- [[Banach fixed point theorem]]
	- [[Hahn-Banach theorem]]
	- [[Open mapping theorem]]
	- [[Uniform boundedness principle]]
	- [[Baire category theorem]]

- Some of these principles and theorems are then needed in [[Partial differential equation]], [[Dirichlet form]], [[Markov semi-group]]/[[Semigroup]] theory
