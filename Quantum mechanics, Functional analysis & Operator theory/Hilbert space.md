# Definition: Hilbert space

**Type:** #definition  

## Definition
- A Hilbert space is a [[Banach space]] whose [[Norm]] comes from the [[Inner product]] defined in its definition
	- $||f||=\sqrt{ <f,f> }$ 
- We write the complex Hilbert space as $(\mathcal{H},+,\cdot,<\cdot,\cdot>)$ , where
	- $\mathcal{H}$ is a set
	- $+:\mathcal{H}\times\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$
	- $\cdot:\mathbb{C}\times\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$
	Satisfy the [[axioms of a complex vector space]] (CANI ADDU)
	- $<\cdot,\cdot>:\mathcal{H}\times\mathcal{H}\to \mathbb{C}$ is a [[sesqui-linear map]] 
	Acting like the [[Inner product]] of the space
	- The space is [[Completeness|complete]]
	This completeness gives that if there is a Cauchy sequence that it converges in $\mathcal{H}$ in the [[Standard topology]] induced by the [[Norm]] induced by the inner product in the definition of the space

## Intuition (optional)
- Every Hilbert space is a Banach space, but not vice versa
	- $L^{2}$ is Hilbert, thus Banach also
	- $L^{1}$ is Banach, but not Hilbert
	- $L^{\infty}$ is Banach, but not Hilbert
	- Sobolev space $H^{1}$ is Banach, but not Hilbert
